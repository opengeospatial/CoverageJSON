== Scope

The specification is a logical implementation of the long-established abstract conceptual standard ISO19123:2005 (also known as OGC Abstract Topic 6). The CoverageJSON specification has been stable for several years, with a wide-spread international community in the environmental sciences. The current version of the open specification, on the https://github.com/covjson/specification[original GitHub], is labelled ‘V0.2-draft’. This document proposes that version, with only editorial changes for presentation, as a Community Standard. 

A formal JSON schema has been added for all the JSON objects identified, so that conformance to the specification can be checked. 

Unused or imprecisely specified components have been removed.

Future improvements have been identified, such as the use of multiple time dimensions, or to use JSON-LD V1.1 which may give better compatibility with the OGC Coverage Implementation Schema (CIS) Version 1.1 (OGC09-146r8), which is a different logical implementation of the abstract conceptual standard ISO19123:2005/OGC Abstract Topic 6. These improvements are out of scope of this document.

This specification does not specify encoding of information in any format other than JSON.
