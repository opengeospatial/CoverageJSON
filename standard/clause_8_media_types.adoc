== Media Type and File Extension

The CoverageJSON media type SHALL be `application/prs.coverage+json` with an optional parameter `profile` which is a non-empty list of space-separated URIs identifying specific constraints or conventions that apply to a CoverageJSON document according to http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6906.txt[RFC6906]. 

The only profile URI defined in this document is `https://covjson.org/def/core#standalone` which asserts that all domain and range objects are directly embedded in a CoverageJSON document and not referenced by URLs. There is no `charset` parameter and CoverageJSON documents MUST be serialized using the UTF-8 character encoding.

The file extension SHALL be `covjson`.
