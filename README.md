# OGC CoverageJSON

This GitHub repository contains documents to produce an OGC Community Standard for CoverageJSON.

The starting point for the standard is the [work by Jon Blower and Maik Riechert of Reading University](https://covjson.org/), under the auspices of the EU Framework 7 MELODIES project in 2015, and other usage by NASA, NCAR and others. 

As there has been little development, though plenty of use, of CoverageJSON since the end of the EU project, and there is no clear governance framework, some key supporters of the format have agreed to ask OGC to adopt CoverageJSON, unchanged, as an OGC Community Standard.

After any adoption, it is proposed that the commonalities and differences with other OGC coverage payload formats, such as CIS-JSON, GeoTiff and NetCDF, be investigated with view to producing a developmental roadmap for CoverageJSON, to be pursued within the OGC governance framework.

The Business Justification for this plan has finished a formal Public Comment period on 25 July 2021 and responses to the received comments were processed at an OGC GoToMeeting session on 28 July 2021. All were agreed to be closed apart from one, which needed more information for a considered meaningful response. Further information was requested from the original commentator.

After more information, the supporters formally processed all the public comments, and the Business Justification was presented to the OGC Technical Committee on 20 September 2021, which, with no objections to unanimous consent, agreed to formally vote on commencing the work. The electronic vote commenced on 28 September 2021 and finished on the 12 November 2021.

The OGC Technical Committee vote was 20 YES votes, 14 ABSTAIN and 5 NO votes, and quorum was readily achieved. So the work is proceeding, under the auspices of the Coverages Standards Working Group. The various comments from the votes will be published and addressed in this repo.

At the December 2021 meeting of the OGC Technical Committee, the following plan was agreed:
